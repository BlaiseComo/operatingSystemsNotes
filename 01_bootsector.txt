- The programmer writes a program using a sequence of assembler instructions
    - These lines of code are source code
    - THe assembler program takes each line of code and generates binary
    - The object code is the sequence of binary
    - The bootstrap loader loads the operating system in BIOS
- A BIOS doesn't know how to load an OS, a bootsector must do this. 
    - The location of a bootsector must be the first sector of the disk (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 0) 
    and it takes 512 bytes
    - To check that the disk is bootable, the BIOS checks that bytes 511 and 512 are bytes 0xAA55
- A very simple boot sector in assembly:
; Infinite loop (e9 fd ff)
loop:
    jmp loop

; Fill with 510 zeros minus the size of the previous code
times 510-($-$$) db 0
; Magic Number
dw 0xaa55

- To compile this program:
nasm -f bin fileName.asm -o fileName.bin

- To run this program:
qemu-system-x86_64 fileName.bin
