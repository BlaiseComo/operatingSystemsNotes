- Memory consists of RAM, Harddisk, cache, and registers
- Short term scheduling programs are programs that control which programs (on ram memory) are passed to the cpu at any given time
- An operating system is essentially a resource manager
- Each core in a CPU is essentially a mini CPU
- Even with only one core, you can have multiple programs inside RAM
- The OS code that controls the other programs taken from the hard drive to the ram is called the scheduler
- The scheduler is responsible for determining the importance of certain processes(programs and/or files)
- Shortest Job First Scheduling Algorithm: Processes with the lowest execution time will be given precedence 
    - Burst time is the same as execution time
    - Turn around Time = Completion time - Arrival Time
    - Your CPU is idle when it is not completing any processes
    - Multiple files can arrive to the same CPU at the same time but have to be bursted seperately
    - Completion time is the time it takes (from when the cpu starts taking in files) for a file to be executed
        - So Completion time is dependent on what other files are being sent to the CPU from RAM
- Shortest Remaining Time First Scheduling Algorithm: CPU keeps track of other files as they arrive, even if there is a file currently executing,
and if a file that has just arrived has a lower execution time than the remaining execution time of the current executing file, then the new file will 
begin to execute
    - If there are two files with the same execution time that are both waiting to be executed, then the file that arrived earlier will be the one that 
    continues to run
- Shedule length is the amount of time it takes a certain number of programs to finish executing
- Throughput is the amount of files executed / the schedule length
- In any non preemptive scheduling algorithm, response time = waiting time, but this may not be true for preemptive scheduling algorithms
